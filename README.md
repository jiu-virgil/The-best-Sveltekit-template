# The best SvelteKit template, probably

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [RemixIcon](https://remixicon.com/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

I believe these tools provide the best experience to both learn Web Development as a beginner and swiftly create scalable websites.

It is especially useful for small projects where you can use [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/) as a backend.

I use it every time I need to make a website as a solo dev and I hope it will help other people too.

## Developing

Make sure to update your packages first with:

```bash
npm update
```

Once you've installed the dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a local development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
